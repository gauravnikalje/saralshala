Debugging Checklist for Responsive Header Implementation

To ensure proper functionality across all devices and browsers, begin by testing the header in mobile emulation mode by opening browser developer tools and selecting various mobile device presets while verifying that text remains readable without overflow and that the logo scales appropriately with fluid font sizing. Check the network tab in developer tools to confirm that SVG files are being served with the correct Content-Type header of image/svg+xml and that PNG fallbacks load when SVG requests fail. Validate SVG accessibility by inspecting the markup to ensure each logo contains a proper viewBox attribute for scaling, uses preserveAspectRatio="xMinYMid meet" for consistent positioning, includes a title element for screen readers, has role="img" attribute, and uses currentColor for fills to maintain color consistency with header text. Disable CSS temporarily by using the developer tools override feature to temporarily remove all styles and verify that the header maintains semantic structure and accessibility without styling dependencies. Clear all browser caches by performing a hard refresh with Ctrl+Shift+R or equivalent keyboard shortcuts and clear application storage in developer tools to ensure changes are reflected properly. Verify server configuration by checking web server settings to confirm SVG files are served with Content-Type: image/svg+xml header rather than text/plain or application/octet-stream. Optimize SVG files using SVGO with the --viewBox preserve plugin to maintain the viewBox attribute while removing unnecessary metadata, comments, and whitespace, ensuring the SVG remains scalable across different viewport sizes. Test accessibility with screen readers to confirm that the header announces the school name and logo properly, and use accessibility checker tools to validate ARIA labels and semantic structure. Finally, verify responsive behavior by manually resizing the browser window to test breakpoints and ensuring the subtitle hides correctly at 420px width while maintaining vertical centering with the flexbox layout.
