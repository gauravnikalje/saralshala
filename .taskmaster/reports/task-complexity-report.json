			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Set up Development Environment and Project Structure",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "No further expansion needed for this task as it is foundational and its subtasks are already well-defined and in progress.",
			"reasoning": "The task is marked 'in-progress,' suggesting much of the initial setup is done. The chosen tech stack (HTML, CSS, JS, Alpine.js, Tailwind CDN) is lightweight and requires minimal build configuration, making the initial setup relatively simple. Supabase project creation and basic Vercel/Netlify deployment are also well-documented processes. The existing 5 subtasks adequately break down the work."

		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement User Authentication",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand subtask 2.5 'Implement Principal-Managed Password Reset Functionality' to explicitly include the design and implementation of a secure backend function (e.g., Supabase Edge Function) to handle Supabase Admin API calls for password resets, ensuring no admin keys are exposed client-side. Also, add a new subtask for defining Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) policies for user roles to enforce access control at the database level.",
			"reasoning": "This task is critical and involves several layers of implementation: UI, client-side Supabase integration, secure role management (which impacts database schema and RLS), and a complex administrative feature (password reset) that requires secure backend interaction with Supabase Admin API. The existing subtasks are a good start, but the password reset subtask is particularly complex due to security considerations and the need for a backend component (e.g., Supabase Edge Function) to handle admin API calls securely. RLS is also a crucial security aspect not explicitly covered."

			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Teacher Dashboard",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "No further expansion needed. The existing subtasks are well-defined and cover the scope of the Teacher Dashboard development.",
			"reasoning": "This task primarily involves UI development using Tailwind CSS and Alpine.js, coupled with data fetching from Supabase. While the individual components (class display, notices, buttons) are not overly complex, integrating them into a cohesive dashboard, handling data loading states, and ensuring reactivity with Alpine.js adds a moderate level of complexity. The existing 5 subtasks provide a good breakdown of these components."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Attendance Module",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "No further expansion needed. The existing subtasks are well-defined and cover the scope of the Attendance Module implementation.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves developing a core application module with significant UI and data interaction. It requires designing a database schema, building a user-friendly interface for class selection and attendance marking, implementing efficient data fetching and batch submission, and integrating with the SMS gateway. The existing 5 subtasks provide a comprehensive breakdown of these components, making the task moderately complex due to the multiple interconnected features."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Principal Dashboard and Reports",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand subtask 5.5 'Implement Report Generation and Export (Attendance & Grades)' into two distinct subtasks: one for implementing CSV export functionality (e.g., for attendance) and another for implementing PDF export functionality (e.g., for grades), each focusing on data retrieval, formatting, and client-side library integration. Consider adding a subtask for optimizing data retrieval for potentially large reports.",
			"reasoning": "This task combines UI development with more complex data aggregation and client-side report generation. Calculating school-wide attendance requires specific Supabase queries. The notice posting feature is a standard CRUD operation. However, the report generation and export functionality is a significant undertaking, involving data retrieval, client-side formatting, and integration with third-party libraries for both CSV and PDF formats, which warrants further breakdown."

		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Admin Setup Module",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Revise subtask 6.1 to reflect the HTML/JS/Alpine.js tech stack (e.g., `src/pages/admin/setup.html`). Expand subtask 6.2 'Implement CSV Bulk Import Frontend' and 6.3 'Develop Backend API for Bulk Data Import' into more granular steps, separating frontend parsing/preview from backend validation/database insertion. Also, ensure subtask 6.5 'Implement Staff Login Credentials Management' explicitly considers the need for secure backend functions (e.g., Supabase Edge Functions) for sensitive Supabase Auth Admin API calls.",
			"reasoning": "This module is central to school administration and involves several complex features. Bulk CSV import requires robust frontend parsing, validation, and a secure, efficient backend for database operations. Timetable management is a significant CRUD interface. Staff credentials management involves sensitive operations with the Supabase Auth API, requiring careful security considerations, potentially including secure backend functions for administrative actions. The existing subtasks are a good start, but the bulk import and staff management subtasks are quite heavy, and the initial subtask has a tech stack mismatch."

		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Design and Implement Data Model in Supabase",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "No further expansion needed. The existing subtasks are well-defined and cover the scope of data model design and implementation.",
			"reasoning": "This task is foundational and involves designing and implementing the core database schema. While the design phase requires careful consideration of relationships and data types, the actual implementation in Supabase is streamlined through its UI or direct SQL. The existing 5 subtasks provide a logical and comprehensive breakdown of the design and implementation steps."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate SMS Gateway API",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "No further expansion needed. The existing subtasks are well-defined and cover the scope of SMS Gateway integration.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves integrating an external API, which typically includes selecting a provider, securely configuring credentials, developing a dedicated service, and integrating it into the application's workflow. The existing 5 subtasks provide a clear and logical breakdown of these steps, including crucial end-to-end testing. The complexity is moderate due to the external dependency and the need for secure credential handling and robust testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Offline Support",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand subtask 9.5 'Implement Attendance Auto-Sync Mechanism' into two distinct subtasks: one focusing on the core logic of sending queued attendance data to Supabase upon network restoration, and another dedicated to implementing robust error handling, retry strategies, and providing clear UI feedback to the user regarding sync status and potential failures.",
			"reasoning": "Implementing robust offline support, especially with data synchronization, is inherently complex. It requires deep understanding of browser APIs (Service Workers, IndexedDB, Background Sync API), careful state management, network detection, and error handling. The existing subtasks cover the necessary components, but the auto-sync mechanism is particularly challenging and warrants further breakdown to ensure reliability and a good user experience."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Testing, Deployment, and Documentation",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Revise subtask 10.1 'Implement Comprehensive Unit and Integration Tests' to specify appropriate testing frameworks for HTML, JavaScript, and Alpine.js (e.g., Jest for JS logic, and potentially a browser-based testing utility for Alpine.js component interactions). Consider splitting this into two subtasks: one for setting up the chosen testing framework(s) and another for writing the actual tests. Also, ensure the CI/CD pipeline (subtask 10.4) correctly integrates these new testing setups.",
			"reasoning": "This task is highly dependent on the completion of all other features and involves significant effort across multiple disciplines: testing, DevOps, and technical writing. The initial subtask for unit/integration tests incorrectly references React-specific tools, which needs correction for the HTML/JS/Alpine.js stack. Setting up a robust testing environment for this stack, writing comprehensive tests, and then integrating them into a CI/CD pipeline is a substantial undertaking."
