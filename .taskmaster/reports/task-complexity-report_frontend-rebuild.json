		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Project Initialization and Setup",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into specific setup steps for Vite/React, Tailwind CSS configuration, and Vercel/Netlify deployment process.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves multiple distinct setup steps (framework initialization, styling configuration, and deployment pipeline), each requiring specific commands and configurations. While common, integrating these components smoothly and troubleshooting potential environment-specific issues can increase effort."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Component File Structure and Core Layout",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand on defining the component directory structure, implementing the Header component (including responsiveness), and implementing the Footer component (including responsiveness).",
			"reasoning": "This task is foundational, establishing the project's component architecture. Implementing the Header and Footer components requires careful attention to detail for navigation, branding, links, and ensuring full responsiveness across various screen sizes, which can be iterative and time-consuming."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "UI Component Library: Button, Card, Input",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Detail the implementation and styling of the Button component (including variants), the Card component, and the Input component, focusing on reusability and adherence to design.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves creating multiple distinct, reusable UI components. Each component needs to be implemented with specific styling (using Tailwind CSS) and potentially variants (e.g., primary/secondary buttons), demanding attention to design consistency and reusability."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Hero Section Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "",
			"reasoning": "This is a relatively simple, self-contained UI section primarily focused on static content display (school name, heading) and basic responsive styling using Tailwind CSS. The option for a background image/video is noted but assumed to be straightforward for initial implementation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "About Section Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "",
			"reasoning": "This task involves creating a standard content display section. It's straightforward, focusing on arranging text and potentially images, and styling them appropriately with Tailwind CSS to match the reference design."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Mission/Vision Section Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "",
			"reasoning": "Implementing a three-column layout is a common and relatively simple task with modern CSS frameworks like Tailwind. It primarily involves structuring content within a grid or flexbox pattern."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Principal's Message Section Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "",
			"reasoning": "Similar to other content sections, this involves displaying text (the message) and an image (the principal's photo) in a specific layout. It's a contained task focused on styling and content presentation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Testimonials Section Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Outline subtasks for researching/selecting a carousel library, integrating it, implementing dynamic content display within the carousel, and ensuring its responsiveness.",
			"reasoning": "The requirement for a dynamic section, specifically a carousel, significantly increases complexity. It often involves integrating a third-party library, configuring it correctly, handling dynamic content, and ensuring smooth interactivity and responsiveness, which can be challenging."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Enquiry Form Section Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for designing the form fields and layout, implementing client-side validation, styling all form elements with Tailwind, and establishing a basic state management structure for form data.",
			"reasoning": "Forms are inherently complex due to multiple input fields, state management, and the crucial requirement for robust client-side validation. Additionally, preparing for future backend integration (Supabase) adds a layer of design consideration for data handling."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Interactivity and State Management",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Detail the implementation of the mobile navigation toggle and menu styling, the smooth scrolling functionality for navigation links, and the state management logic for the enquiry form.",
			"reasoning": "This task combines several distinct interactive features – implementing mobile navigation logic (hamburger menu), adding smooth scrolling for links, and managing the state of a complex form. Each of these elements requires careful logic, integration with existing components, and thorough testing."
