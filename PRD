### **Comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD)**

* **Project:** School Administration Software
* **Version:** 1.0 (MVP)
* **Date:** 2025-09-21

---

### **1. Project Vision & Core Objective**

* **Primary Objective:** To digitize the entire workflow of a rural Marathi school of 1200 students and provide an efficient way for the Principal and Teachers to organize their core administrative tasks.
* **Problem Statement:** The school's current workflow is entirely offline, relying on physical paper registers for attendance, grades, and timetables. This process is time-consuming for teachers, prone to manual errors, and provides zero real-time operational visibility for the Principal. Communicating urgent information is slow and inefficient.
* **Elevator Pitch:** We are building a simple, mobile-first web app for a rural Marathi school that digitizes their most critical tasks—attendance, timetables, notices, and grades. Unlike bloated, expensive ERP systems, our solution is purpose-built to be so intuitive that teachers can use it without training, giving them more time to teach and providing the Principal with instant oversight.
* **Target Audience:** The staff of a specific rural Marathi-medium school with ~1200 students. The primary users are teachers and the school Principal, who have limited technical expertise but are comfortable with smartphones.
* **Market Opportunity:** The main competitors are large, generic School ERP systems that are often too complex, expensive, and feature-heavy for the needs of a smaller, rural school. Their weakness is their "one-size-fits-all" approach. Our product will be better because it is **purpose-built for simplicity and user adoption**, focusing only on the essential features, making it faster, more affordable, and a more beloved choice for its users.

### **2. User Personas & Stories**

* **Primary Persona:** **The Teacher ("Mrs. Kulkarni")**. A teacher aged 40-55, whose primary language is Marathi. Her goal is to manage her classroom duties efficiently. Her frustrations are the hours wasted on repetitive paperwork like marking attendance and calculating grades. Her technical skill level is basic; she is proficient with WhatsApp but intimidated by complex software with many menus and options.
* **Secondary Personas:**
    * **The Principal ("Mr. Deshpande"):** The head of the school who needs quick, high-level summaries of school operations (attendance, performance) to make informed decisions.
    * **Admin Staff:** Clerical staff who will handle the initial data entry and occasional administrative updates.
* **Core User Story:** "As a Teacher, I want to mark attendance for my class on my phone in under two minutes so that I can minimize administrative work and focus on teaching."
* **Key User Scenarios:**
    1.  **Marking Attendance:** Teacher logs in -> Dashboard shows the next class -> Taps "Mark Attendance" -> Taps "Mark All Present" -> Untaps the few absent students -> Taps "Save".
    2.  **Checking Notices:** Teacher logs in -> Sees a new notice alert on the dashboard -> Taps the notice to read the full message -> Taps a "Seen" button to acknowledge.
    3.  **Entering Grades:** Teacher navigates to Grades -> Selects Class, Subject, and Exam -> Enters marks into a simple, Excel-like table on their phone -> The system saves automatically.
* **Edge Case Users:** Explicitly **out of scope for V1**. Roles for substitute teachers, Heads of Department, or a Vice-Principal will not be created. These users will use shared credentials from a primary teacher or the Principal on a temporary basis to maintain simplicity.

### **9. Assumptions, Constraints, & Risks**

* **Assumptions:**
    * We assume all teachers have access to a basic Android smartphone with a mobile data connection during school hours.
    * We assume the school administration will allocate staff resources for the one-time data entry task.
* **Constraints:**
    * **Timeline:** There is a hard deadline of 8 weeks for the MVP launch.
    * **Budget:** Ongoing monthly costs must be kept within the ₹3,500–₹7,500 range.
    * **Team:** The project will be built by a two-person team.
* **Risks:**
    * **Timeline Risk:** The 8-week schedule is aggressive and leaves little room for unexpected delays.
    * **Data Quality Risk:** The initial data's accuracy depends on manual entry from paper registers, which could introduce errors.
    * **Adoption Risk:** Despite training, there may be some resistance to change from staff accustomed to paper-based methods.
