## Testing Instructions

### 1. Teacher Login Flow

2. Use teacher credentials: `sarah.johnson@school.com` / `sarah123`
3. Verify teacher-specific dashboard loads
4. Check "Profile" button appears for teacher users
5. Test teacher-specific quick actions

### 2. Teacher Dashboard Features
- **Current Class**: Should show Mathematics - Class 10A with room and student details
- **Mark Attendance**: Teacher-specific functionality

### 3. Teacher Profile Page

2. Verify complete teacher information displays
3. Check teaching schedule with current class highlighted
4. Review classes taught and performance statistics

### 4. Role Switching Test
1. Login as teacher, verify teacher dashboard
2. Logout and login as principal (`principal@school.com` / `admin123`)
3. Verify principal dashboard shows school overview instead of current class
4. Confirm no "Profile" button for principal users

## Technical Implementation

### Authentication System
```javascript
// Multiple role support
const validCredentials = {
    'principal@school.com': { password: 'admin123', role: 'principal' },
    'teacher@school.com': { password: 'teacher123', role: 'teacher' },
    'sarah.johnson@school.com': { password: 'sarah123', role: 'teacher' }
};
```

### Role-Based Content Display
```javascript
// Conditional content based on user role
x-show="user?.role === 'teacher'"
x-show="user?.role === 'principal'"
```

### Session Management
```javascript
// Store user context
sessionStorage.setItem('user', JSON.stringify({
    email: this.email,
    role: credential.role,
    name: userName
}));
```

## Benefits for Task 3 Development

1. **Complete Teacher Authentication**: Ready-to-use teacher credentials for testing
2. **Role-Based Dashboard**: Foundation for teacher-specific features
3. **Teacher Profile System**: Comprehensive teacher information management
4. **Scalable Architecture**: Easy to extend with additional teacher features
5. **Professional UI/UX**: Consistent design pattern with animated gradients

## Next Steps for Collaborator

The Task 3 branch can now focus on:
1. Advanced teacher features (gradebook, lesson planning)
2. Student management for teachers
3. Parent communication systems
4. Assessment and examination tools
5. Teacher reporting and analytics

## Integration Notes

- All authentication flows are compatible with both Task 2 and Task 3
- Consistent design patterns maintained across all pages
- Role-based routing and access control implemented
- Ready for Supabase integration when moving to production

This implementation provides a solid foundation for Task 3 teacher dashboard development while maintaining compatibility with the existing Task 2 authentication system.
